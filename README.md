# Lyric Site

# Introduction
Welcome to my lyrics site where you can search for a song by name to find the lyrics.

# Full Contents
The site contains a home page with a searchbar and a page containing the lyrics requested. I chose this as my topic because I like music and wanted to  get a site started that I could continue to expand overtime and add features.
